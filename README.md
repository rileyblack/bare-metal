Collection of low-level C programs developed using the [Intel FPGA Monitor](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/fpga-academic/tools.html) to run directly on [ARM](https://www.arm.com/) hardware in the absence of operating systems, device drivers, etc. The [DE-10](https://fpgacloud.intel.com/devstore/board/de10-standard/) standard computer used as a tinkering platform was comprised of an Altera Cyclone V (ARM Cortex A9 + FPGA) and various I/O components.
